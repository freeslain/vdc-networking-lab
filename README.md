# Azure VDC Networking lab

Artifacts for the VDC lab.

The lab itself is found in the <https://github.com/azurecitadel/azurecitadel> repository, in the /content/network/vdc folder.

The Jekyll rendered Citadel pages can be found at <https://azurecitadel/network/vdc>.

The old decks are in the subfolder.

Kudos to [Adam Raffe](https://github.com/Araffe) for the original labs.
